================================================================================

Beleza is a portable SDL2 demo - proof of concept. Supported operating systems:
    - Android
    - iOS
    - Linux
    - Mac OS X
    - Windows


1. Build from Source
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Beleza relies on a well estalished open source tools for longevity. However,
   it may be troublesome to get your toolchain to work for some platfroms.

   The build toolchain is:
   - C++
   - CMake
   - Git


1.1 Mac OS X

    To build anything with Mac OS X you need XCode from Apple's App Store. I
    also recommend to install MacPorts and HomeBrew, to easily install any open
    source tools to your system.

    Prebuild frameworks have to be installed to ~/Library/Frameworks, as:

    - SDL2.framework
    - SDL2_image.framework
    - SDL2_ttf.framework
    - SDL2_mixer.framework

    If anything is in place you are ready to build the project:
    - Traverse into the root directory of Beleza
      $ cd beleza
    - Create an external build directory and get into it
      $ mkdir build.macosx
      $ cd build.macox
    - Create an Xcode project
      $ cmake .. -G Xcode
    - Build the Xcode project from command line
      $ xcodebuild -configuration Release

    If everything's fine, that's all for Mac OS X.
        

1.2 iOS

    Building Beleza for iOS (device or simulator) is anything but trivial.
    As for OSX you also rely on Xcode, and have to download it from Apple's App
    Store. Anything additional open source libraries have to be custom build, as
    there exist nothing prebuild to rely on.

    I tried to simplify all the complicated things by providing bash scripts.

    At first you need all the SDL sources. Simply run the sdl2.sh scripts
    $ scripts/sdl2.sh

    Then you have to build all the SDL sources, using another script:
    $ . scripts/ios-sdl2.sh
    
    As I use CMake as build tool, I decided to use ios-cmake. To set up an alias
    in your shell run the next script (and check with the alias command):
    $ source scripts/ios-cmake.sh

    Now, you should be ready to build the project for iOS
    - Travere into the Beleza directory
      $ cd beleza
    - Create an external build directory and get into it
      $ mkdir build.ios
      $ cd build.ios
    - Create an Xcode project
      $ ios-cmake ..
    - Build the Xcode project from command line 
      $ xcodebuild -sdk iphonesimulator -configuration Release

    NOTE: You may get a link error due to an Xcode bug. Fix it with symlinks:
    $ ln -s Release-iphonesimulator Release
    $ ln -s Debug-iphonesimulator Debug
